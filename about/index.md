# Hi. I'm Yatish

I am a software engineer. I strive towards producing elegant, beautiful, pragmatic and well-tested code.
I love working on web products and consider myself a full-stack engineer. 
I primarily work on Ruby on Rails and Javascript. I have been using it since 2011. 

I studied Computer Science at University of Pune. I am doing my masters from North Carolina State University (Go Pack!!)

I worked at [Betterlabs](http://www.betterlabs.net/). I was involved for the development of
[DataDoctor](http://datadoctorit.com/) and [Nurture](http://www.nurturehq.com/). 
Next, I worked for a New York based startup [Fab](fab.com). 
and [Sungard](http://www.sungardas.com/Pages/default.aspx).
My latest gig was at Office of CTO, [VMware, Palo Alto](http://www.vmware.com/).

I love learning and experimenting with new technologies. I love studying modern design trends.
I spend time reverse engineering layouts of interesting websites.
Currently, I am obsessed with [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Go](https://golang.org/). 
I am also trying some stunts with Python.
Working with infrastructure gives me a kick. I like writing recipes to orchestrate my infrastructure.
I prefer writing automation scripts. This enables me to sit back and enjoy my Frappuccino.

I am an open-source evangelist. I contribute to multiple projects. I help people resolve issues on IRC.
I have authored several gems(>25K downloads). I regularly speak at Ruby meetups.

In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and sitcoms. I am a big fan of Suits.
I like reading tech entrepreneurs' biographies. Recently, I have been obsessed with working out at the gym(I hope it continues).

I am [@yatish27](https://twitter.com/yatish27) on twitter, IRC and Github. Feel free to give a shout out.
