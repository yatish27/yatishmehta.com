# Hi. I'm Yatish

I am a software engineer. I strive towards producing elegant, beautiful, pragmatic, well-tested code. 
I love working on web products and consider myself a full-stack engineer. 
I primarily work on Ruby on Rails and Javascript. I have been using it since 2011. 

I studied Computer Science at University of Pune. I am doing my masters from North Carolina State University(Go Pack!!)

I worked at [Betterlabs](http://www.betterlabs.net/). I was involved in the development of 
[DataDoctor](http://datadoctorit.com/) and [Nurture](http://www.nurturehq.com/). 
Next, I worked for a New York based startup [Fab](fab.com). 
Then [Sungard](http://www.sungardas.com/Pages/default.aspx). 
My latest gig was at Office of CTO, [VMware, Palo Alto](http://www.vmware.com/).

I love learning and experimenting with new technologies. I love studying new design trends. 
I get hooked reverse engineering people's CSS and layout using inspect element. 
Currently, I am obsessed with [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Go](https://golang.org/). 
I am also trying some stunts with Python. 
Working with infrastructure gives me a good kick. I like writing recipes to orchestrate my infrastructure. 
I write automation scripts so that I can sit back and enjoy my Frappuccino.

I am an open source evangelist. I contribute to multiple open source projects. I help people resolve issues on IRC. 
I have authored couple of gems(>25K downloads). I speak at ruby meetups regarding my experiences. 

In my free time, I watch movies and sitcoms. I am big fan of Suits. 
I like reading tech entrepreneurs biographies. I am recently obsessed with working out at the gym(I hope it continues).

I am [@yatish27](https://twitter.com/yatish27) on twitter, IRC and Github. Feel free to give a shout out.
