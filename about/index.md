# Hi. I'm Yatish

I am software engineer. I strive towards producing elegant, beautiful, pragmatic, well-tested code. I love working on web products and consider myself a full-stack engineer. I primarily work on Ruby on Rails and Javascript. I have been using it since 2011. 

I studied Computer Science at University of Pune. I did/doing my masters from North Carolina State University(Go Pack!!)

I worked at [Betterlabs](http://www.betterlabs.net/). I was involved in the developement of [DataDoctor](http://datadoctorit.com/) and [Nurture](http://www.nurturehq.com/). Later on I worked at New York based startup [Fab](fab.com) and then [Sungard](http://www.sungardas.com/Pages/default.aspx). My latest gig was in the Office of CTO at [VMware, Palo Alto](http://www.vmware.com/).

I use Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, jQuery, RSpec, SCSS as my main tools. I love learning new tools. I am always involved experimenting with them. I love studying new design trends. Many a times I get hooked reverse engineering people's CSS and layout using inspect element. Currently, I am obsessed with [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Go](https://golang.org/). I am also trying some stunts using Python. Working with infrastructure also gives me a good kick. I like writing recipies to orchestrate my infrastrcuture. I write automation scripts for my tasks so that I can sit back and enjoy my frappuccino.

I am an open source evangelist. I contribute to multiple open source projects or help people resolve issues on IRC. I have authored couple of gems(>21K downloads). I speak at ruby meetups regarding my experiences. 

In my freetime I watch movies and sitcoms. I am big fan of Suits. I like reading tech entrepreneurs biographies. Recently I have picked my obsession with working out at the gym (I hope it continues).

I am @yatish27 on twitter, IRC and Github. Feel free to give a shout out.
