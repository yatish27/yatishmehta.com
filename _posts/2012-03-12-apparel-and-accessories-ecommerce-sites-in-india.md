* [Myntra.com](http://www.myntra.com/) Started in 2007 by three IIT alumni as a simple e-commerce portal,
it now has transformed into a multi-brand online fashion store.
After raising three rounds of funding of around $39 million, it has become a big player in the e-commerce space.
Developed in PHP, the site is fast and intuitive. They have a very versatile choice in apparels.
Their collection includes all top brands.

* [Jabong.com](http://www.jabong.com/) Founded in 2011, by an amazing trio, Jabong has managed to make a mark 
very soon due to it's aggressive and innovative marketing strategy. A PHP site with Citrix Netscalar platform, it is fast.
Initially, Jabong was known for women’s accessories and clothes. Now it has around 30000 products. With around more than $10 million funding by
the German incubator Rocket Internet, Jabong looks like a good bet. I had a very good experience shopping with Jabong.

* [Zovi.com](http://www.zovi.com) The first of its kind in India for being an exclusive online brand. Being able to raise $15 million funding,
Zovi is growing at a very good speed. Recently, it launched its tele-marketing campaign. It has its headquarters
in Bangalore. It has managed to recruit many former Oracle employees. Developed in python, the site does not lack speed.
I like the 'looks' feature which provides head to feet clothing for a certain theme. It has a very simple and minimalist UI
Being a self-brand, its prices are reasonable compared to other e-commerce stores.

* [BeStylish.com](http://www.bestylish.com) The biggest online shoe store in India. It has shoe brands from Adidas to
Hush Puppies. Unfortunately I am not comfortable with buying shoes online, so I don't have a first
hand experience. Developed in Magento (PHP e-commerce framework) the site has a good speed and average user experience.
With initial funding of $8.5 million, I think going ahead with shoe accessories can be worthwhile.

* [Freecultr.com](http://www.freecultr.com) Another e-commerce site selling a variety of fashion apparel ranging
from shirts to footwear for men and women. Developed on Magento, the user interface is similar to most of e-commerce sites.
freecultr.com managed is the apparel partner for Shahrukh's IPL team KKR.
With more than $9 million of funding within seven months freecultr has found its space in the e-commerce space.

* [Thestiffcollar.com](http://www.thestiffcollar.com) As the name suggests, this store specializes in shirts. 
Their prime selling point is premium formal shirts. It does not have range of collection.

* [Yepme.com](http://yepme.com) Another e-commerce selling products ranging from t-shirts to footwears.
The UI is similar to most e-commerce sites.
Despite of being on ASP.NET it has good speed, but unfriendly SEO URLs. It is the only e-commerce which
is available in five languages. It offers the generic services like COD and 30 day return, but lacks versatility in catalog.

* [Inkfruit.com](http://inkfruit.com) Inkfruit started with custom design t-shirt portal. It was known for having 
very innovative graphic designs for t-shirts. Initially it lacked quality, but after series of funding from major 
VCs it has risen and is one of the major players in apparel and accessories eCommerce.

* [Bewakoof.com](http://www.bewakoof.com) IIT alumni start-up for t-shirts, it is known for its very innovative tag liner 
t-shirts. They also do have the famous "troll" t-shirts which have made them out of the box. Though the site looks 
incomplete, it is trustworthy. I just ordered the "the big bang theory" t-shirt and it was delivered on time. 
They do not have Cash on Delivery *EDIT*: They do have cash on delivery now. The major USP of the site is its comic 
and youth appealing content which has managed 
them to get them more than two lakh likes on their facebook page. I will surely recommend to have look at it.

* [Bagskart.com](http://bagskart.com) Bags, clutches, handbags almost everything in the bag category is 
available at bagskart. It also has sister sites like lenskart, jewelskart and watchkart which specialize in their own categories. 
Due to its speciality in a particular accessory category, it has a very good choice of products. 
This site is made with Magento on a custom theme. 

* [Bluestone.com](http://www.bluestone.com) bluestone.com is an online jewellery store. 
It has accessories from earrings to pendants in many designs.Though people are still hesitant to buy jewellery online, 
this store is able to attract customers. It has novel range of designs.
With a funding of $5 million from Accel Partners and headquarters at Bangalore, Bluestone is progressing at an appreciable pace.
