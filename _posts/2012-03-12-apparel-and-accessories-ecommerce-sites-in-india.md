* [Myntra.com](http://www.myntra.com/) Started in 2007 by three IIT alumni as a simple e-commerce portal, selling 
cool products like mugs, caps, bags, Sweatshirts, it now has transformed into a multi-brand online fashion store. 
After raising 3 rounds of funding of around $39 million, it has become a big player in the e-commerce space. 
Developed in PHP, the site is quite fast and has a very intuitive user experience. But I have to admit that too many choices 
make it confusing to shop and select. They have a very versatile choice in apparels. Almost all top brands with the latest fashion 
trend are available in their catalogues.

* [Jabong.com](http://www.jabong.com/) Founded in 2011, by an amazing trio, Jabong has managed to make a mark 
very soon due to it's aggressive and innovative marketing strategies. Like every multi brand fashion e-commerce, Jabong 
has almost every brand on its plate. A PHP site with Citrix Netscalar platform, it lacks no speed. Jabong, initially 
known for womenâ€™s accessories and clothes, now has around 30000 products. With around more than $10 million funding by 
the German incubator Rocket Internet, Jabong looks like a good bet. I had a very good experience shopping with jabong, 
but would like if they had more innovative products.

* [Zovi.com](http://www.zovi.com) The first of its kind in India for being an exclusive online brand. Zovi itself is a brand 
which retails apparel and accessories for men and women under its own brand name. Being able to raise $15 million funding, 
Zovi is growing at a very good speed, recently launching its marketing campaign on television. It has its headquarters 
in Bangalore and has managed to recruit many former Oracle employees. Developed in python, no wonder the site is super fast. 
I like the 'looks' feature which provides head to feet clothing for a certain theme. It has a very simple and colourful UI 
with SEO friendly URLs. Being a self-brand, its prices are reasonable compared to other e-commerce stores.

* [BeStylish.com](http://www.bestylish.com) The Biggest online shoe store in India. It has shoe brands from adidas to 
Hush puppies with a variety of choices. Unfortunately I am not comfortable buying shoes online, so I don't have a first 
hand experience, but a word of mouth suggests excellent product quality. Developed in Magento (PHP e-commerce framework) 
the site has a good speed and average user experience.  With initial funding of $8.5 million, I think going ahead with 
shoe accessories can be worthwhile.

* [Freecultr.com](http://www.freecultr.com) Another Ecommerce site selling a variety of fashion apparel ranging 
from shirts to footwear for men and women. Developed on Magento, the User interface is similar to most of e-commerce sites. 
Though expensive, freecultr is worth a try. freecultr.com managed to bag the title of apparel partner for Shahrukh's IPL team KKR. 
With more than $9 million of funding within seven months freecultr has found its space in the eCommerce space.

* [Thestiffcollar.com](http://www.thestiffcollar.com) As the name suggests, this store specializes in shirts. 
Premium formal shirts have been their selling point. Magneto site, but lacks crowd appealing UI. It does not have a 
variety of choices which makes it difficult to be in the big league. 

* [Yepme.com](http://yepme.com) Yet another eCommerce site selling everything from t-shirts to footwear. 
Yepme has the similar layout as most of the eCommerce sites. It has an average variety. 
Inspite of being on ASP.NET it has a very good speed, but unfriendly SEO URLs. It is the only e-commerce which
is available in five languages. It offers the generic services like COD and 30 day return, but lacks versatility in catalogue.

* [Inkfruit.com](http://inkfruit.com) Inkfruit started with custom design t-shirt portal. It was known for having 
very innovative graphic designs for t-shirts. Initially it lacked quality, but after series of funding from major 
VCs it has risen and is one of the major players in apparel and accessories eCommerce.

* [Bewakoof.com](http://www.bewakoof.com) IIT alumni start-up for t-shirts, it is known for its very innovative tag liner 
t-shirts. They also do have the famous "troll" t-shirts which have made them out of the box. Though the site looks 
incomplete, it is trustworthy. I just ordered the "the big bang theory" t-shirt and it was delivered on time. 
They do not have Cash on Delivery *EDIT*: They do have cash on delivery now. The major USP of the site is its comic 
and youth appealing content which has managed 
them to get them more than two lakh likes on their facebook page. I will surely recommend to have look at it.

* [Bagskart.com](http://bagskart.com) Bags, clutches, handbags almost everything in the bag category is 
available at bagskart. It also has sister sites like lenskart, jewelskart and watchkart which specialize in their own categories. 
Due to its speciality in a particular accessory category, it has a very good choice of products. 
This site is made with Magento on a custom theme. 

* [Bluestone.com](http://www.bluestone.com) bluestone.com is an online jewellery store. 
It has accessories from earrings to pendants in many designs.Though people are still hesitant to buy jewellery online, 
this store is able to attract customers. It has novel range of designs.
With a funding of $5 million from Accel Partners and headquarters at Bangalore, Bluestone may be going slow, 
but at an appreciable pace.
